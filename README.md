# 🌐 Cisco CCNA Networking Portfolio
**Aspiring Network Engineer | Java Developer | CCNA Candidate**

Welcome to my central repository for my Cisco networking journey. This portfolio documents my progress through the Newport CISCO CCNA course, featuring hands-on labs in routing, switching, and security. 

With a background in **Java (AP CSA)**, I am particularly interested in **NetDevOps**—bridging the gap between traditional networking and automated, code-driven infrastructure.
